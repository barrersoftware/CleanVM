# CleanVM

**Virtualization that doesn't waste your time.**

## What is CleanVM?

A KVM-based hypervisor that cuts through enterprise complexity and just works.

- **Direct IP mapping**: Have multiple IPs? Assign them to VMs directly. No bridges, no NAT, no bullshit.
- **Simple web UI**: Create a VM, assign resources and IP, done.
- **Smart networking**: Auto-detects your network topology and configures everything correctly.
- **No manual configs**: No XML files, no hunting through forums, no weekends lost to troubleshooting.

## Born from frustration

Built because Proxmox and ESXi make simple things complicated.

## Status

🚧 Initial concept - December 2024

## Vision

"Create VM, assign IP 15.204.158.242, done."

That's it. That's what this should be.
